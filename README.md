# Online Marketplace Management System
The C++ application is an online marketplace management system that allows users to register, login, and perform various functions based on their roles: seller, customer, or admin.

## Sign in as Seller:
<ul>
<li>The seller can add new products to the system, but the products are pending admin approval before they are displayed on the marketplace for customers.</li>
<li>The seller can add quantities to existing products already approved by the admin.</li>
<li>The seller can browse their own products to view their inventory and details.</li>
</ul>

## Sign in as Customer:
<ul>
  
<li>The customer has access to different categories of products such as appliances, books, fashion, food & beverage, smartphones, laptops, and accessories.</li>
<li>The customer can view products from a specific category or view all products together. Each product has essential details like name, ID, price, category, and quantity.</li>
<li>The customer can search for products by their names.</li>
<li>The customer can add products to their shopping cart, remove items from the cart, remove all products from the cart, or confirm the cart's content for purchase.</li>
<li>After confirming the cart, the customer can view the receipt with details of the purchased items and total cost.</li> 
</ul>

## Sign in as Admin:
<ul>
  <li>The admin has the authority to approve or reject the products added by sellers before they become available for customers on the marketplace.</li>
<li>The admin reviews the pending product requests from sellers and makes a decision to approve or disapprove them.</li>
</ul>

## Additional Notes:
<ul>
<li>During registration, the system enforces specific conditions for the email and password to be valid.</li> 
<li>Once registered, the system assigns a unique ID to each user.</li> 
<li>Sellers' product additions go through an approval process by the admin to ensure product quality and relevance.</li> 
<li>>Customers have access to different categories of products to explore and purchase.</li
<li>The shopping cart functionality allows customers to add, remove, and confirm their purchases before checking out.</li>
<li>The admin plays a crucial role in managing product approvals and ensuring the marketplace's quality and integrity.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Overall, the application provides a user-friendly online marketplace platform that facilitates product management for sellers, product browsing and purchasing for customers, and product approval for the admin to maintain a well-functioning and secure marketplace environment.</h4>
