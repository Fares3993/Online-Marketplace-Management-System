# Online Marketplace Management System
The C++ application is an online marketplace management system that allows users to register, login, and perform various functions based on their roles: seller, customer, or admin.

## Sign in as Seller:
<ul>
<li>The seller can add new products to the system, but the products are pending admin approval before they are displayed on the marketplace for customers.</li>
<li>The seller can add quantities to existing products already approved by the admin.</li>
<li>The seller can browse their own products to view their inventory and details.</li>
</ul>

Sign in as Customer:

The customer has access to different categories of products such as appliances, books, fashion, food & beverage, smartphones, laptops, and accessories.
The customer can view products from a specific category or view all products together. Each product has essential details like name, ID, price, category, and quantity.
The customer can search for products by their names.
The customer can add products to their shopping cart, remove items from the cart, remove all products from the cart, or confirm the cart's content for purchase.
After confirming the cart, the customer can view the receipt with details of the purchased items and total cost.
Sign in as Admin:

The admin has the authority to approve or reject the products added by sellers before they become available for customers on the marketplace.
The admin reviews the pending product requests from sellers and makes a decision to approve or disapprove them.
Additional Notes:

During registration, the system enforces specific conditions for the email and password to be valid.
Once registered, the system assigns a unique ID to each user.
Sellers' product additions go through an approval process by the admin to ensure product quality and relevance.
Customers have access to different categories of products to explore and purchase.
The shopping cart functionality allows customers to add, remove, and confirm their purchases before checking out.
The admin plays a crucial role in managing product approvals and ensuring the marketplace's quality and integrity.
Overall, the application provides a user-friendly online marketplace platform that facilitates product management for sellers, product browsing and purchasing for customers, and product approval for the admin to maintain a well-functioning and secure marketplace environment.
